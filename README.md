## Prebuilt Binaries for Windows

For CueStack, CueStackClient, and VoicemeeterAgent, we have prebuilt binaries for Windows here: [dist](dist). For CueStack and VoicemeeterAgent, you will need a config file, see [Quick Start](CueStack/README.md#quick-start) 

You may need to install [Visual C++ Redist 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145), but this is probably only needed for older versions of Windows.
