## Installation

**NOTE**: NodeJS 10.13.0 or higher is required.

```bash
# change the working directory to insta-growth
$ cd audio_trigger

# install NodeJS & npm & WebSocketServer if they are not installed

```

## Usage
**Now we are ready to run the software**. In the terminal, within the path indicated in the upper section, we are ready to proceed and run the program.
